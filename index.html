      <h2>My Journey into Web Development</h2>

      <p>I started learning web development a few months ago, and it has already been one of the most exciting experiences of my life. At first, the world of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript felt overwhelming, but over time I began to see how these technologies work together to build the web pages we use every day. Each line of code I wrote gave me more confidence, and soon I was creating layouts and styling them on my own.</p>
      <p>What motivates me most is the ability to create something that others can see and use. From a simple blog page like this to larger projects in the future, I know that every step I take is building the foundation of my career in tech. Web development has shown me the importance of problem-solving and persistence, and I am excited to keep pushing forward.</p>

      <h2>Balancing School and Coding</h2>

      <p>Being a student while also learning to code can be challenging, but it has taught me the value of time management. Between lectures, assignments, and personal projects, I’ve learned to prioritize what matters most and stay consistent with my goals. Coding doesn’t always come easy, but setting aside even an hour each day makes a big difference over time.</p>
      <p>I’ve also discovered that coding is not just about typing commands into a computer—it’s about creativity, logic, and building solutions. Whenever I solve a tough problem or finally get my code to work after hours of trying, the sense of accomplishment makes it all worth it. Balancing school and coding isn’t always easy, but I know the skills I’m building now will open doors for me in the future.</p>
